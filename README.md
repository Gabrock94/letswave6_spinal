Letswave 6 - Matlab EEG signal processing toolbox 

Letswave is a free software toolbox to analyze electroencephalographic (EEG) and other neurophysiological signals. This new version has been rewritten entirely, taking into consideration structural limitations of Letswave 5.  As compared to existing signal processing toolboxes, emphasis is placed on intuitive and streamlined tools to process and visualize EEG data, with a shallow learning curve. The new version provides advanced scripting possibilities. 
 
The project is managed by André Mouraux (Institute of Neuroscience, Université catholique de Louvain, Belgium), in collaboration with Bruno Rossion (Institute of Neuroscience, Université catholique de Louvain), Li Hu (Southwest University, China) and Giandomenico Iannetti (University College London, UK).
